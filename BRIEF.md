## For Developers (Technical Description)

$JACKPOT is a Web3-enabled slot machine game built on the Base network. Key technical aspects include:

1. **Frontend**: Built with React and Next.js, utilizing Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

2. **Blockchain Interaction**: Uses Web3.js to interact with smart contracts on the Base network.

3. **Smart Contracts**: 
   - $JACKPOT Token: `0x2C8dD0b0604Cc478ada32bEb7bC415e94ED4DE32`
   - Claim Contract (JackpotGame): `0x6e10E33824FB98C72872bA1D04C4964afe1f919f` (Note: This address will need to be updated after new deployment)
   - $CLANKSTER Token: `0x3E1A6D23303bE04403BAdC8bFF348027148Fef27`

4. **Real-time Updates**: Fetches live token prices from the DexScreener API and updates the prize pool in real-time.

5. **State Management**: Uses React hooks for local state management.

6. **Wallet Integration**: Supports MetaMask and other Web3 wallets for transactions and account management.

7. **Game Logic**: Implements a random number generation for slot spins (Note: This should be moved to a verifiable on-chain function in production).

8. **Token Economics**: Integrates $JACKPOT for gameplay and $CLANKSTER for daily free plays.

9. **Smart Contract Simplification**: The JackpotGame contract has been simplified to remove the approvedAddresses mapping, streamlining the claim process.

10. **Gas Optimization**: Implements gas estimation and adjusts gas limit for claim transactions to ensure smooth operation.
